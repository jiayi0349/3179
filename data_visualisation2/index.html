      <div class="pure-u-1-1">
      <p><strong>Life expectancy</strong> is a key indicator for assessing the health status of a population. 
        Further analyses are necessary to determine how the distribution of wealth in a country has 
        an overall impact on life expectancy through certain investments in <strong>health care, education, 
        environmental stewardship</strong> and <strong>socio-economic factors</strong>.</p>
        <p>The three areas that unfold in the visualization below are <strong> Public health,
           the economic status of the population</strong>, and <strong>environmental factors</strong>.</p>

        <p>The <strong style="color: darkgreen;">map visualization</strong> depicts the distribution of global life expectancy 
          counted during 2019, the color of the markers represents the 
          degree of longevity of the life expectancy, the darker the color, 
          the longer the life expectancy of the country.</p>
        <p>Overall, most countries have a life expectancy of around <strong style="color: darkgreen;">70 years</strong>,
           which is a relatively normal range, but there are particularly striking 
           examples. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="pure-u-1-2"><p> The <strong style="color: darkgreen;">lightest color</strong> on the map represents the country with the 
        lowest life expectancy, which is <strong style="color: darkgreen;">Chad</strong>, with a life expectancy of <strong style="color: darkgreen;">54.239</strong>.</p>
        <p>
         The <strong style="color: darkgreen;">darkest color</strong> represents the country with the highest life expectancy, 
         which is <strong style="color: darkgreen;">Japan</strong>, with a life expectancy of <strong style="color: darkgreen;">84.356</strong>. The difference 
         between these two countries is almost twice as great!</p>

          <p>In the Visualization, five nationally representative countries were selected to explore

        <div class="pure-u-1-2">
        <p>Among them, it can be seen that the best improvement in 
        public health is <strong style="color: #984ea3;">in China</strong>, which has risen from <strong style="color: #984ea3;">13% to 68%</strong> over time, 
        and the most obvious change that follows is the concomitant increase in life expectancy.</p>
        <p>In other countries, public health has risen less, but it can also be seen that 
          life expectancy has steadily increased as public health has grown. Therefore, 
          it can be seen that the <strong>state of public health is one of the factors affecting life expectancy</strong>.</p>

        <p>Higher economic levels usually mean better living conditions, 
          including better diet, housing and health care. Countries with 
          higher levels of economic development usually have longer life expectancy.</p>

          <p>Current level of health expenditures expressed as a percentage of GDP. 
            Estimates of current health expenditure include annual consumption of medical 
            goods and services. Five representative countries were selected for the study, 
            and this data suggests that <strong style="color: #377eb8;">Thailand</strong> has consistently had a smaller share of health 
            spending and <strong style="color:#e41a1c ;">Australia</strong> a larger share, but both have experienced smooth changes in this area. </p>

      <div class="pure-u-1-2">
        <p>In the visualization, counts were 
          calculated for all countries in the 
          income bracket over the years 2001 to 2019.
           From the pie chart, it can be concluded that 
           among the countries of the world, the share of 
           <strong>high-income</strong> people is the largest, followed by <strong>upper-middle income</strong>, 
           and the lowest share of counts is for <strong>low-income</strong> people.</p>
        <p>But people living in poverty tend to face more health risks, as they may not have access 
          to basic needs such as quality health care, a healthy diet and housing. This means that 
          people living in poverty tend to have lower life expectancy, which is one of the factors associated with life expectancy.</p>
          <p>Next are health expenditures and malnutrition rates, also related to consumption levels</p>
          <div id="vis6" class="vis-container"></div>
          <p>The <strong>prevalence of malnutrition</strong> is defined as the percentage of the population
             whose habitual food consumption is insufficient to meet dietary needs. 
             In this bar chart, the percentage of the population in each region is added up and a ranking is made.<strong>Sub-Saharan Africa</strong> consistently has the 
             highest percentage of undernourishment and represents the poorest region. <strong>North America</strong> has the lowest percentage of undernourishment, which also represents the richest</p>

           dioxide from the consumption of solid, liquid and gaseous fuels and from the combustion of natural gas. </p>
